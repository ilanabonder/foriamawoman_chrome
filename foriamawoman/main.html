      As a  response to the highlighted excerpt of the orthodox jewish morning blessing,
      this Chrome Extension displays daily, at 11AM, a pop up in your browser
      with information about a different people whose examples help define,
      establish, and achieve political, economic, personal,
      and social equality of genders.</p>

      <p class= "text1">
        * Like other western worlds major religions (Christianity and Islam) Judaism fosters gender hierarchy and traditional gender ideologies. In the Orthodox daily
        prayer service, men thanks God who has not made me a woman, whereas the parallel
        blessing for women is thanking God for making me according to his will.</p>
